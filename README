Graph Drawing
By: Dave Tu

SUMMARY

GraphDrawing draws pretty graphs in 3D. It currently uses a force-directed
algorithm that attempts to separate vertices by a unit length. Each vertex
feels a force proportional to its distance from nearby vertices (adjusted by a
unit distance). Simple numerical integration is used to reach a stable
configuration because it will be a local minimum in kinetic energy. In
addition, there is a position multiplying factor that causes the vertices to
tend away from each other, causing the graphs to become as evenly spaced out as
possible.

In the future, other algorithms will be used and added.

RUNNING

The program is a Java/Processing applet. Open index.html to see it in action.
Run it from the command line using "java GraphDrawing". The processing/ folder
contains the Processing library needed to run it.

Rotate the graph by dragging the mouse.

COMPILING

Type "javac GraphDrawing.java" from the command line.

NOTES

The applet takes adjacently lists as input. The graphs/ folder has examples of
graphs represented in this format. Note that there are lines in
GraphDrawing.java that can be uncommented to enable an Open File Dialog when
run locally. They are removed because of the restriction that unsigned applets
cannot access the filesystem.
